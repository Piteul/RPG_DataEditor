# RPG_DataEditor

## Use the Data Editor Tool

You can access the tool in the Unity Header, under the "Tools" category. Quite Simple.

The **Data Editor Tool** allows you to view and manage assets relating to classes : Character, Item and Spell.
It allows you to create, delete, duplicate and edit assets. These are located in the _"Assets/Resources/GameData"_ folder and then in their respective sub-folder.

The manipulable elements are **Scriptable Objects**, saved in .asset file. In addition, they contain all of their data in **JSON** form.

Although there is a semi-automatic data refresh, do not hesitate to use the Refresh button if necessary.

Finally, you find a set of prebuilt assets _to play with_.
